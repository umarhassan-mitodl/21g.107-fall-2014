How to Browse Web Pages with Chinese Characters
-----------------------------------------------

IE: In most cases, the browser automatically detects the encoding of the characters and displays them correctly. But if it is gibberish, go to View, then Encoding, and then choose Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, or Unicode.

Safari & Firefox work in pretty much the same way.

Now: Give it a try! {{% resource_link "a3667c2a-6093-4aef-9422-2b7f89f7dfe9" "The Unknown Space" %}}, the first BBS (Bulletin Board System) for Chinese students studying abroad, and in fact, the favorite of many even today—first started by, of course, MIT's international students from China in the early 1990s.

How to Input Chinese Characters with Pinyin
-------------------------------------------

For our discussion board, you can input directly using Global IME. Or you can use one of the other systems and cut and paste.

### Option 1: Unicode Global IME from Microsoft

Once you have the fonts and IME installed, nearly any Windows application is capable of interacting with the IME to accept unicode Chinese input. To input traditional characters, click on the "EN" icon in the task bar, and choose to "Show the Language Bar". Click on "EN" and choose "Chinese (PRC)". Then, click on the little triangle on the lower right corner of the language bar and click on "character set". A "Jian Charset" toggle button will show up in the language bar. You can then choose between simpliefied charactersa dn traditional characters.

### Option 2: Chinese Mac Input Method {{% resource_link "9064073a-acac-47de-a2f8-7d5dc77887d7" "Guide" %}}.

Recommended input methods: ITABC for simplified characters and "Pinyin" for traditional characters.
